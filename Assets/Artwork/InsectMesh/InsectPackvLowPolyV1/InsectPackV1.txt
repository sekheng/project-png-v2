Prefab Models:
All models are already ready for use in practical prefab already generated and ready for you you just place them in the scene.


optimizations:

1-Models Lowpoly saving on quantities of polygons
2-Skeleton:
Using a few bones but that guarantee a realistic movement necessary in order to ease the calculation.
3-Animations
Using short animations, big impact, Savings Calculation.
4-TextureAtlas:
Including homestyle considerable savings calculation.





Ps important:
it is possible that many models generally understood you present a notice in the console:
ImportFBX Warnings:
Can not import tangents and binormals, Because mesh.
It frequently happens that Unity3D present this message because of particular exports and good to note that this does not mean that the model and compromise.
proceed in this way:
the item Model / Normals and Tangents.
Normals:
Calculate

Smooting angle = 180
Tangents
Calculate Legacy
Apply


Very low FPS, to increase FPS calculation :
it is possible to resize compress  textures ,to obtain a higher value  of fps:
select single image ,inspector pannel:
 ,Max size 8192,  resize and change  4096 or 2048 or lower
the lower the compression the higher the FPS will rise




this pack compatible Only legacy not compatible with other 	
typology of animations
however, you can try to convert legacy to try the following:
                                          
 First you Ctrl-D to duplicate each animation and then click each animation copy you made and go to debug mode
 in the inspector and uncheck legacy mode. Then you click on the parent of each models and where it says animation
 type in the inspector you choose generic and click apply.
